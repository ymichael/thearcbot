Be aware that a too low threshold may result in a lot of false-positives, and a too high threshold may result in a lot of false-negatives.\n\n    twss.threshold = 0.5;\n    twss.is(\"You're hardly my first.\"); // false\n\n    twss.threshold = 0.3;\n    twss.is(\"You're hardly my first.\"); // true\n\nAdditional functions\n--\n**twss.probability**\n\nIf you'd just like the probability that a sentence can be replied with \"That's what she said\" you can use the `twss.probability` function.\n\n    twss.probability(\"Behold, I come quickly.\"); // 0.956323045469951\n\nOr just use the alias `twss.prob`\n\n    twss.prob(\"The juice keeps coming out of the wrong hole!\") // 0.9961630818418142",
